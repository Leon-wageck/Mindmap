# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge
We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Being kind and respectful
- Assuming good intent and asking clarifying questions
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what’s best for the community and users
- Using welcoming and inclusive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing), including OSINT targets’ personal data
- Threats of violence or encouraging self-harm
- Deliberate disruption of discussions, reviews, or community spaces

## OSINT & safety expectations (project-specific)
This project can be used to organize investigation notes. Contributors must:
- Avoid sharing or requesting sensitive personal data about private individuals.
- Not provide instructions or features intended to facilitate wrongdoing (e.g., stalking, harassment, illicit access, doxxing).
- Treat reported vulnerabilities, abuse patterns, and sensitive security topics responsibly.

## Enforcement responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and may temporarily or permanently ban contributors for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, code review) and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers by opening a GitHub issue labeled `conduct` (if safe to do so), or by contacting the repository owner via their GitHub profile.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainers will respect the privacy and security of the reporter as much as possible.

## Enforcement guidelines
Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines:

1. **Correction**: A private or public warning with clarification.
2. **Warning**: A formal warning, possibly with conditions for continued participation.
3. **Temporary ban**: Temporary exclusion from project interaction.
4. **Permanent ban**: Permanent exclusion from project interaction.
